## What is CodeSync?
[CodeSync](https://www.codesync.com) streams your code in real-time to the cloud, allowing you to review the entire history of the codebase on the web.
- Review your coding progress every day. *(What did I **actually** write today?!)*
- Align with teammates. *(Never again be surprised by a Pull Request!)*
- Or, rewind back to any point in the past. *(Never again lose code you didn't commit!)*

## Get Started

Simply install an IDE plugin from the plugin marketplace. It'll then guide you through the steps.
